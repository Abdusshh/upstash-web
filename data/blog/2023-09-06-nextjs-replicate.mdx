In this article, we will show you how to rate limit a Next.js app using Upstash Redis. We will be rebuilding [lofianime.com](https://www.lofianime.com/), an app that generates AI images with a Stable Diffusion model on Replicate. We will focus predominantly on how to implement Upstash rate limiting with a Redis database. You can checkout the original source code for this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/alpinecodex/lofianime).

## Why use Upstash?

To avoid high API costs incurred from using hosted AI models, it’s imperative that we rate limit our API routes. Upstash provides an SDK that allows us to easily do this.

## Getting Started

We will create a Next.js application and deploy it to Vercel. Alternatively, you can clone the [lofianime repository](https://github.com/alpinecodex/lofianime) from GitHub, or use one-click deployment from the repo's README file.

## Project Setup

Create a new Next.js project. Make sure to enable the `App Router`, and `tailwindCSS`. We will use Javascript instead of Typescript for sake of simplicity.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Install @upstash/ratelimit:

```bash
npm install @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/redis
```

Install the Replicate Node SDK:

```bash
npm install replicate
```

## Database Setup

Create a Redis database using the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/) or the [Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli). Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` variables and place them in the `.env.local` file in the root directory of your Next project.

## Replicate AI Setup

Create a [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) account. Click on your profile icon and select “API Tokens”. Create a new API token and save it in your `.env.local` file as `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`.

## Making the API Route

Create a new API route called `app/api/ai/route.js`. In this route, we will use Upstash Redis to create a rate limit as well as use the Replicate SDK to generate an image.

Your route should look like this:

```jsx
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import Replicate from "replicate";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";

const redis = new Redis({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
});

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: redis,
  limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(5, "1440 m"),
});

const replicate = new Replicate({
  auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN,
});

export async function POST(request) {
  const identifier = "api-route";
  const result = await ratelimit.limit(identifier);

  if (!result.success) {
    return NextResponse.json("No generations remaining.", {
      status: 429,
      headers: {
        "X-RateLimit-Limit": result?.limit,
        "X-RateLimit-Remaining": result?.remaining,
      },
    });
  }

  const { prompt } = await request.json();

  try {
    const output = await replicate.run(
      // This is the ID of the replicate model you are running
      "doriandarko/sdxl-hiroshinagai:563a66acc0b39e5308e8372bed42504731b7fec3bc21f2fcbea413398690f3ec",
      {
        input: {
          prompt: "In the style of HISGH. " + prompt,
          // ... other model parameters
        },
      }
    );

    return NextResponse.json(output, {
      headers: {
        "X-RateLimit-Limit": result?.limit,
        "X-RateLimit-Remaining": result?.remaining,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json("An error occurred. Please try again later.", {
      status: 500,
    });
  }
}
```

Let’s break this code down. We first create a Redis client using the Upstash SDK. We then use that client to create a RateLimit of 5 requests with a fixed window of 1440 minutes, or 24 hours. Then, we create an instance of Replicate for our image generation. Using Next.js route handlers, we define a function to handle `POST` requests. In this example, we limit all requests for the app. However, by getting an `email` or `IP address`, we can rate limit on an individual visitor level. In our `POST` function, we check if the user has remaining generations. If they have reached their limit, we return a response with a `429` HTTP status code and set the headers with the limit and the remaining amount.

If the user does have remaining generations, we grab the prompt from the request and run the Replicate model using the SDK. Then, we return the output of the model with the Upstash Redis limit data in the response headers.
