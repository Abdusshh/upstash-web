## Build a Leaderboard at Edge using Upstash Redis and Fly.io

In dynamic and engaging web applications, leaderboards are a powerful tool for fostering competition and user engagement. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll embark on a journey to build a real-time leaderboard using **[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/?utm_source=valon)** as the backend storage and deploy it at the edge with Fly.io. This dynamic duo combines the efficiency of a serverless Redis service with the global distribution capabilities of Fly.io, ensuring low-latency access for users worldwide.

## About Upstash Redis

**[Upstash is a cloud service](https://upstash.com/?utm_source=valon)** that provides a fully managed Redis service with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. Redis, known for its versatility and high-performance in-memory data store capabilities, becomes even more compelling when paired with Upstash. With Upstash, developers can seamlessly deploy and scale Redis for various use cases without the operational complexities associated with infrastructure management.

Key features of Upstash Redis include:

* **Ease of Deployment:** Upstash simplifies the deployment process significantly, making it an excellent choice for developers who want to reduce the operational complexities associated with infrastructure.

* **High Performance:** Redis is known for its lightning-fast data retrieval, making it suitable for handling task queuing, message passing, and, as weâ€™ll explore in this tutorial, real-time leaderboards. With Upstash, you can rely on cloud infrastructure for seamless scaling, ensuring your applications can handle varying workloads efficiently.

* **Scalability:** Redis is highly scalable, and with Upstash, it can scale automatically based on demand. This ensures that your application is always equipped to handle varying levels of load, making it an ideal choice for dynamic and scalable applications.

* **Data Store Integration:** Redis serves both as a message broker and a result store, streamlining the architecture by reducing the number of components you need to manage.

By incorporating Upstash Redis into our real-time leaderboard application, we harness the power of a fully managed Redis service that complements the global distribution capabilities of Fly.io, resulting in a robust and responsive web application architecture. Letâ€™s dive into the implementation and showcase how Upstash Redis can elevate your projects to new heights.

## Prerequisites

Before we start on our journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* An **[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/?utm_source=valon)** account.

* A **[Fly.io](https://fly.io/)** account.

* Basic knowledge of Flask and Python.

## Set Up Upstash Redis

Start by **[creating an account in Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/login?utm_source=valon)** and then create a Redis instance. Once created, obtain the connection string, a crucial piece of information to establish a seamless connection between your Flask application and Upstash Redis. Store the value somewhere as we are going to use it later.


## Develop the Flask Application

To create our leaderboard we are going to use Flask. Flask is a minimal Python framework for building web applications. So letâ€™s start by installing the dependencies.

```shell
    # flask - for as a web application framework
    # redis - A wrapper to connect and interact with Redis
    # gunicorn - wsgi server for running Python web applications

    $ pip install flask redis gunicorn

    # export the dependencies to requirements.txt
    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now, letâ€™s lay the foundation for our Flask app. Start by creating a module app.py and letâ€™s write the minimum code to initiate a Flask application and connect to the **[Upstash Redis.](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted?utm_source=valon)**

 ```python
 import os

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)

# Read the connection string from the environment variable
UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING = os.getenv('UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING')
LEADERBOARD_KEY = 'leaderboard'

# Initiate a connection to Upstash Redis Instance using the connection string
redis_client = redis.from_url(REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING)
 ```

So we:

* Initiated a Flask app

* Read the `UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING` from environment variable

* Initialized a `redis_client` to interact with our Upstash Redis Database

Now letâ€™s define functions to add a player to the leaderboard and retrieve the players with the respective scores from the leaderboard:

```python
def add_score(player_id, score):
    # Add or update the score for the player in the leaderboard
    redis_client.zadd(LEADERBOARD_KEY, {player_id: score})


def get_leaderboard():
    leaderboard = redis_client.zrevrange(LEADERBOARD_KEY, 0, 9, withscores=True)

    formatted_leaderboard = [{'player_id': player_id.decode('utf-8'), 'score': int(score)} for player_id, score in
                             leaderboard]

    return formatted_leaderboard
```
The function **add_score** gets a **player_id** and a **score** and adds it to the leaderboard.**zadd** is a command in Redis that is used to add one or more members with scores to a sorted set.

The second function **get_leaderboard()** retrieves the top 10 entries with scores from a Redis sorted set (leaderboard), and returns them in a formatted list containing player IDs and their corresponding scores.

Okay, now letâ€™s add three endpoints to interact with our Upstash Redis database.

* **[GET]** / â€” retrieve the leaderboard

* **[POST]** /submit_score â€” Submit the score in the leaderboard

* **[GET]** /clear_table â€” Clears up the leaderboard

```python
@app.route('/')
def leaderboard():
    # Retrieve the top 10 players from the leaderboard and redirect to the leaderboard page with the data
    leaderboard = get_leaderboard()
    return render_template('leaderboard.html', leaderboard=leaderboard)


@app.route('/submit_score', methods=['POST'])
def submit_score():
    player_id = request.form['player_id']
    score = int(request.form['score'])

    # Call the function to add or update the score for the player in the leaderboard
    add_score(player_id, score)

    return redirect(url_for('leaderboard'))


@app.route('/clear_table', methods=['GET'])
def clear_table():
    # Delete all the data from the leaderboard
    redis_client.delete(LEADERBOARD_KEY)

    return redirect(url_for('leaderboard'))
```

As we can see, we are also rendering a front-end page leaderboard.htmlto make this more interactive and in real time. At the root of the project, create a folder templates , and inside create a file leaderboard.html **[with the following code](https://github.com/vjanz/upstash-leaderboard/blob/main/templates/leaderboard.html)**

Perfect, now to test this locally in your terminal load up the environment variable:

```shell
# Linux
export UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING='YOUR_UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING'

# Windows
set UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=YOUR_UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING

# After that run:
$ flask run
```
Your application should be ready with a leaderboard and a way for you to add records to the leaderboard.

As you add the results, you can easily see that the results will be stored updated, and sorted in real-time, which is exactly what we wanted to do! ðŸŽ‰

## Deploy to Fly.io

Now, letâ€™s elevate our Flask app to new heights by deploying it to Fly.io. Initiate the process by installing the Fly CLI:

```bash
# Linux
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Other type of installation: https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/
```

Now from the root of your codebase, execute:
```shell
flyctl launch

Scanning source code
Detected a Python app
Using the following build configuration:
        Builder: paketobuildpacks/builder:base
Creating app in /home/valon/code/personal/upstash-leaderboard
We're about to launch your Python app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: <MyOrg>          (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         upstash-leaderboard    (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Amsterdam, Netherlands (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)

? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? (y/N)
```
This will detect your codebase and will apply some default configuration based on your application name, code, etc. I will continue with default settings so I will continue withN .

Now this will generate a fly.toml and a Procfile:
```shell
app = "upstash-leaderboard"
primary_region = "otp" # I just make this to OTP as it's free!

[build]
  builder = "paketobuildpacks/builder:base"

[env]
  PORT = "8080"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080 # Port where the app runs
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ["app"]

[[vm]]
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 1024
  ```


I will leave everything as default, except the region that I change to otp. Now letâ€™s update Procfile, where the execution command is defined, and make it run with gunicorn in the 8080 port.
```shell
web: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
```
Where app is the module name and the other app is the variable defined in the module where we defined the Flask app. We are mostly done, but remember in the code we added the UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING as an environment variable, letâ€™s set this up as a secret in fly.io.
```shell
fly secrets set --app upstash-leaderboard UPSTASH_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=<>
```

We are all ready, letâ€™s deploy the app to **fly.io** now:
```shell
fly deploy --ha=false
```

the output should give us the URL to visit our newly deployed application.

```shell
Watch your deployment at https://fly.io/apps/<app_name>/monitoring

-------
Updating existing machines in '<app_name>' with rolling strategy

-------
 âœ” Machine <machine_id> [app] update succeeded
-------

Visit your newly deployed app at https://<app_name>.fly.dev/
```
