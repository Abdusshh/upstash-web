                  Upstash has been designed to be serverless from day 1. You
                  create the database without knowing about the backend servers.
                  We maintain it, we deal with any issue if anything happens.
                  With the `pay-as-you-go` pricing, you only pay when you
                  actively use the database. Your cost does not increase
                  proportionally to your data size. See Serverless Model for
                  more information.
